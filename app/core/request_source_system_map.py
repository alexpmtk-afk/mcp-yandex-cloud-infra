_EXTRA_INSTRUCTIONS = """
For every natural marketplace request, use marketplace_query_plan as the first server-side planning step before choosing archive, seller-cabinet/API, public-card/site, or other data tools.
The top-level planner chooses a source family before lower Semantic Core chooses a metric, report, field, or endpoint. Code/module presence never proves that historical data is actually populated.
The planner returns marketplace_execution_plan.v2: every required source leg has its own source family, source status, downstream executor, execution status, coverage gate, required context and forbidden substitutes.
There is currently no verified populated WB historical orders archive and no historical stock archive. Recent WB orders may use the operational cabinet API only within its supported retention window; older order history must fail closed. Historical stock must fail closed and must never receive today's snapshot.
Public marketplace/card facts are a separate source family from private seller-cabinet facts. If an on-demand public source is not connected, report that source gap instead of substituting cabinet or archive data.
Questions that require several domains must produce separate source legs and validate each leg before joining results. All required legs are mandatory by default; if one required leg is unavailable, the final joined answer must fail closed rather than silently returning a partial answer.
Never perform cross-source arithmetic or derived business calculations merely because two source legs exist. Arithmetic joins require an explicit approved Semantic contract, and provenance must be preserved for every leg.
