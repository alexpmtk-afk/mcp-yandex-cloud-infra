For every natural marketplace request, use marketplace_query_plan as the first server-side planning step before choosing archive, seller-cabinet/API, public-card/site, or other data tools.
The top-level planner chooses a source family before lower Semantic Core chooses a metric, report, field, or endpoint. Code/module presence never proves that historical data is actually populated.
There is currently no verified populated WB historical orders archive and no historical stock archive. Recent WB orders may use the operational cabinet API only within its supported retention window; older order history must fail closed. Historical stock must fail closed and must never receive today's snapshot.
Public marketplace/card facts are a separate source family from private seller-cabinet facts. If an on-demand public source is not connected, report that source gap instead of substituting cabinet or archive data.
Questions that require several domains must produce separate source legs and validate each leg before joining results.
