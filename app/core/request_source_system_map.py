_EXTRA_INSTRUCTIONS = """
For every natural marketplace request, use marketplace_query_plan as the first server-side planning step before choosing archive, seller-cabinet/API, public-card/site, or other data tools.
The top-level planner chooses a source family before lower Semantic Core chooses a metric, report, field, or endpoint. Code/module presence never proves that historical data is actually populated.
The planner returns marketplace_execution_plan.v2: every required source leg has its own source family, source status, downstream executor, execution status, coverage gate, required context and forbidden substitutes.
Before any provider, archive, card-monitor, or calculation executor is called, apply the Clarification Gate. If execution_plan.status is NEEDS_CONTEXT, ask the user only for the missing context reported by the plan. If semantic_resolution is AMBIGUOUS, explain that several business meanings are possible and ask the user to choose or clarify the intended meaning. If semantic_resolution is UNKNOWN, or the upper source class is unresolved because the business meaning is not safely identified, say that the request is not yet recognized precisely enough and ask what exact business result the user means. Never guess the closest metric.
A recognized multi-source request is not ambiguous merely because it needs several data domains: create separate source legs and continue when each meaning is clear. Conversely, when the meaning is clear but a required source/executor is genuinely unavailable, report that source gap rather than asking an unnecessary semantic clarification.
When clarification is required, ChatGPT/Codex must present the clarification in normal user-facing language and must not execute any data leg. After the user answers, call marketplace_query_plan again using the clarified request while preserving known marketplace, seller/cabinet, period and product context. Do not resume the old ambiguous plan directly. Repeat this loop until the replanned request is READY or READY_WITH_GATES, or until a genuine source gap is established.
After a READY or READY_WITH_GATES plan, call marketplace_execution_control before every provider/archive/card executor. Query Execution Controller V1 is the canonical server-side owner of per-leg executor arguments. Use only the executor name and exact executor_arguments returned in dispatch_contracts; do not rewrite, broaden, merge, or supplement them client-side.
Never pass the original compound multi-source user question unchanged into several lower executors. The controller must turn every required leg into marketplace_leg_execution.v1 with its own narrow business meaning, source contract, coverage gate, forbidden substitutions and provenance requirements. If any required leg cannot get a deterministic execution contract, dispatch_contracts must be empty and no other required leg may run as a partial answer.
After every required multi-source executor result has returned, call marketplace_join_control before presenting a joined multi-source synthesis. Pass each result with the exact contract_id returned by marketplace_execution_control. Join Controller V1 rebuilds the execution control server-side, rejects missing/duplicate/unexpected results, checks semantic target and required coverage, and authorizes only a registered join contract.
Join permission and arithmetic permission are separate. V1 registers only a descriptive side-by-side WB comparison of sale_and_return_operations with advertising_performance for the same requested seller/period. It does not authorize subtraction, ratios, totals, percentages, DRR, ROAS, profitability or any other derived cross-source metric.
Calculation Contract Registry V1 is the server-owned gate for future derived metrics. Every future contract must explicitly define its business meaning, registered semantic inputs and value paths, marketplace, seller/period scope alignment, source-family restrictions, per-input coverage requirement, currency policy, output data class and provenance; ratio contracts must also define zero-denominator behavior. Client-authored formulas and implicit currency conversion are forbidden. A contract that merely passes registry validation is still not executable: it must be explicitly present in the runtime registry and a separate calculation executor must be implemented. The runtime registry currently contains zero cross-source formulas.
There is currently no verified populated WB historical orders archive and no historical stock archive. Recent WB orders may use the operational cabinet API only within its supported retention window; older order history must fail closed. Historical stock must fail closed and must never receive today's snapshot.
Public marketplace/card facts are a separate source family from private seller-cabinet facts. If an on-demand public source is not connected, report that source gap instead of substituting cabinet or archive data.
Questions that require several domains must produce separate source legs and validate each leg before joining results. All required legs are mandatory by default; if one required leg is unavailable, the final joined answer must fail closed rather than silently returning a partial answer.
Never perform cross-source arithmetic or derived business calculations merely because two source legs exist. Arithmetic joins require an explicit approved Semantic calculation contract, currency alignment must be proven rather than inferred, and provenance must be preserved for every leg.
