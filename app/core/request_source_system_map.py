_EXTRA_INSTRUCTIONS = """
For every natural marketplace request, use marketplace_query_plan as the first server-side planning step before choosing archive, seller-cabinet/API, public-card/site, or other data tools.
The top-level planner chooses a source family before lower Semantic Core chooses a metric, report, field, or endpoint. Code/module presence never proves that historical data is actually populated.
The planner returns marketplace_execution_plan.v2: every required source leg has its own source family, source status, downstream executor, execution status, coverage gate, required context and forbidden substitutes.
Before any provider, archive, card-monitor, or calculation executor is called, apply the Clarification Gate. If execution_plan.status is NEEDS_CONTEXT, ask the user only for the missing context reported by the plan. If semantic_resolution is AMBIGUOUS, explain that several business meanings are possible and ask the user to choose or clarify the intended meaning. If semantic_resolution is UNKNOWN, or the upper source class is unresolved because the business meaning is not safely identified, say that the request is not yet recognized precisely enough and ask what exact business result the user means. Never guess the closest metric.
A recognized multi-source request is not ambiguous merely because it needs several data domains: create separate source legs and continue when each meaning is clear. Conversely, when the meaning is clear but a required source/executor is genuinely unavailable, report that source gap rather than asking an unnecessary semantic clarification.
When clarification is required, ChatGPT/Codex must present the clarification in normal user-facing language and must not execute any data leg. After the user answers, call marketplace_query_plan again using the clarified request while preserving known marketplace, seller/cabinet, period and product context. Do not resume the old ambiguous plan directly. Repeat this loop until the replanned request is READY or READY_WITH_GATES, or until a genuine source gap is established.
There is currently no verified populated WB historical orders archive and no historical stock archive. Recent WB orders may use the operational cabinet API only within its supported retention window; older order history must fail closed. Historical stock must fail closed and must never receive today's snapshot.
Public marketplace/card facts are a separate source family from private seller-cabinet facts. If an on-demand public source is not connected, report that source gap instead of substituting cabinet or archive data.
Questions that require several domains must produce separate source legs and validate each leg before joining results. All required legs are mandatory by default; if one required leg is unavailable, the final joined answer must fail closed rather than silently returning a partial answer.
Never perform cross-source arithmetic or derived business calculations merely because two source legs exist. Arithmetic joins require an explicit approved Semantic contract, and provenance must be preserved for every leg.
